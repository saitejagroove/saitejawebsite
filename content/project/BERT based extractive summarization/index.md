title: BERT based summarization using transfer learnig and Centroid Clustering technique 
summary: This project investigates the usability of BERT pretrained models with few additional FC layers to get latent representation of sentences. We also explore the use of centroid clustering to summarize a long paragraph of review into 2-3 relevant and important sentences with an effective compression rate of around 80%.

This is my first deep learning project in NLP. I  worked on it along with 2 wonderful team mates as part of our Deep learning in NLP course at UIC. While they worked on sentiment analysis, I wanted to see the power of BERT and transformers when used for transfer learning to solve various issues. Meanwhile, I explored a new method where they try to extract summaries based on clustering.
